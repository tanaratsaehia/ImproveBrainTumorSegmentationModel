1.[Done] update model structure to present
    1.1 [Done] currently modify u_net_bipyramid_di.py not finish yet
    1.2 [Done] must be add another file like u_net_di.py for fully separatly
    1.3 [Done] add note for se block for tell their position to add it
2.update training code
    2.1 [Done] flexible option for easy to use
    2.2 [Passed] save model (best and last)
    2.3 [Passed] resume training
    2.4 [Passed] auto stop when almost 3 hour
    2.5 [Done] early stoping
    2.6 [Done] fix random seed
    2.7 [Done] Stop training when hit setting epoch (because loop on h-100 infinity)
3.add mlflow to tracking
    3.1 [Done] config mlflow server
    3.2 [Done] add to training code
    3.3 [Fixed] got problem with kku vpn when lost and reconnection ip will change overtime
4.test run training
    [Running] to find any problem if not have any problem then can run full loop to train model
    4.1 [verified] is the most time in each epoch are training model not preprocess or other to make training script or efficient
        we got the actual problem: Epoch 16/25 Complete 2725.31s | Preprocess Time: 1878.94s | Training time: 174.05s | Validate time: 672.26s
